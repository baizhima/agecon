2. Estimate a hedonic regression for the HousePrices data taken from Anglinand Gen¸cay (1996), which contain prices of houses sold in the city ofWindsor, Canada, during July, August, and September 1987. These dataare also used in the textbook by Verbeek (2004).Estimate a hedonic regression for the HousePrices data taken from Anglinand Gen¸cay (1996), which contain prices of houses sold in the city ofWindsor, Canada, during July, August, and September 1987. These dataare also used in the textbook by Verbeek (2004).
(a) Fit a multiple linear regression model to the logarithm of the price,using all remaining variables as regressors. Experiment with modelscontaining lot size, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, andstories in logarithms and in levels, respectively. Which model do youprefer?
```
# regression 1 stories in logarithms
hp_lm <- lm(log(price) ~ lotsize + bedrooms + bathrooms + log(stories),data = HousePrices)
summary(hp_lm)
# regression 2 stories in levels
hp_lm2 <- lm(log(price) ~ lotsize + bedrooms + bathrooms + as.factor(stories),data = HousePrices)```
#####问题：哪个模型更好？1好。 模型2对lotsize使用level会使变量个数过多，因此尽管模型2的R^2大（0.687>0.674），但是根据AIC和BIC，可以判断1更好   

```
> AIC(hp_lm,hp_lm2)          df         AIC  hp_lm   13 -134.238547  hp_lm2 302    1.894209  > BIC(hp_lm,hp_lm2)          df       BIC  hp_lm   13  -78.3045  hp_lm2 302 1301.2851  ```
(b) What is the expected price of a two-story house of 4,700 sq. ft. withthree bedrooms, two bathrooms, a driveway, no recreational room, afull finished basement, without gas heating or air conditioning, andtwo-car garage, that is not located in a preferred area? Report also a prediction interval.
```
hp_predict <- predict(hp_lm, newdata = data.frame(lotsize = 4700, bedrooms = 3,
                                    bathrooms = 2, stories = 2, driveway = "yes",
                                    recreation = "no", fullbase = "yes",
                                    gasheat = "no", aircon = "no",
                                    garage = 2, prefer = "no"), 
                      interval = "predict")```#####问题 这种房子的预测值和预测区间？  预测值11.26，预测区间[11.2045,11.3238]   

```  
> hp_predict       fit      lwr      upr1 11.26422 11.20461 11.32382
```
(c) In order to determine whether the logarithmic transformation of thedependent variable is really appropriate, a Box-Cox transformationmight be helpful. Use the function boxcox() from the package MASS.What do you conclude?   
#####问题 对数变换是合适么？  补充知识：lambda是一个待定变换参数，对于不同的lambda,所作变换不同。lambda = 0是对数变换，=1/2是平方根变换，=-1是倒数变换.
合适，本题95% likelyhood at lambda = 0.2 near 0~~-------------~~  
Use the PSID1982 data and consider the following two nonnested models(compare with Baltagi 2002, p. 230):  (a) Compute the J tests for M1 vs. M2 and M2 vs. M1, respectively.

```
rm(list=ls()) # clean workspace
data("PSID1982") # include data
# (a) Compute the J tests for M1 vs. M2 and M2 vs. M1, respectively.
m1 <- lm(log(wage) ~ education + experience + I(experience ^ 2) + weeks + married
         + gender + ethnicity + union, data = PSID1982)
m2 <- lm(log(wage) ~ education + experience + I(experience ^ 2) + weeks + occupation
         + south + smsa + industry, data = PSID1982)
# J test M1 vs. M2
jtest(m1,m2)
```
##### 问题 计算J检验M1对M2,M2对M1  
?jtest  
The idea of the J test is the following: if the first model contains the correct set of regressors, then including the fitted values of the second model into the set of regressors should provide no significant improvement. But if it does, it can be concluded that model 1 does not contain the correct set of regressors.   
由检验结果可知，M1和M2再添加上对方的变量时，新模型显著，因此之前的m1(m2)模型应该添加m2(m1)中的变量
 
```
J testModel 1: log(wage) ~ education + experience + I(experience^2) + weeks +     married + gender + ethnicity + union   Model 2: log(wage) ~ education + experience + I(experience^2) + weeks +     occupation + south + smsa + industry                    Estimate  Std. Error t value  Pr(>|t|)     M1 + fitted(M2)  0.93805   0.121285  7.7343 4.571e-14 ***   M2 + fitted(M1)  1.05393   0.089818 11.7342 < 2.2e-16 ***   ---Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
```
(b) Both M1 and M2 can be artificially nested within a larger model. Usean F test for M1 versus this augmented model. Repeat for M2 versusthe augmented model. What do you conclude?
```aug_m <- lm(log(wage) ~ education + experience + I(experience ^ 2) + weeks + married
             + gender + ethnicity + union + occupation
             + south + smsa + industry, data = PSID1982)
anova(m1,aug_m)
anova(m1,aug_m)
```
由下图可见，augmented_model相比m1和m2来说，明显要好(AER pp.92)

3.The function ivreg() from package AER will fit instrumental variable(IV) regressions. Using the USConsump1993 data taken from Baltagi(2002), estimate the simple Keynesian consumption function
$$ expenditure\_{t} = \beta_{0} + \beta\_{1} income\_{t} + \epsilon\_{t} $$ 
(a) by OLS   
    
```
rm(list=ls()) # clean workspace
data("USConsump1993") # include data
consump_lm <- lm(expenditure ~ income, data = USConsump1993)
```  
(b) by IV. The only available instrument is investment, given by theidentity expenditure + investment = income.  

```
consump_iv <- ivreg(expenditure ~ income | income - expenditure,data = USConsump1993)
```
(c) Compare both sets of estimates using a Hausman test, thus replicatingBaltagi (2002, Section 11.7). What do you conclude?
